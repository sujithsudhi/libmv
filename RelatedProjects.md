# Introduction #

In this describes other computer vision libraries and software.

# General Purpose Computer Vision Libraries #

  * [OpenCV](http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/)
  * [VXL](http://sourceforge.net/projects/opencvlibrary/)
  * [OpenVIDIA](http://openvidia.sourceforge.net/) low-level vision using nVidia hardware.
  * [NASA Vision Workbench](http://ti.arc.nasa.gov/visionworkbench/)
  * [BIAS](http://www.mip.informatik.uni-kiel.de/~wwwadmin/Software/Doc/BIAS/html/)

# Calibration Libraries and Tools #
There is and extensive list of links [here](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/bouguetj/calib_doc/htmls/links.html)

  * Bouguet's [Camera Calibration Toolbox for Matlab](http://www.vision.caltech.edu/bouguetj/calib_doc/)
  * [DLR Camera Calibration Toolbox](http://www.dlr.de/rm-neu/desktopdefault.aspx/tabid-3925/)


# 3D Reconstruction Libraries and Tools #
  * [Bundler](http://phototour.cs.washington.edu/bundler/) - This is the code used in Microsoft's Photosynth project (or at least, was the first implementation).
  * [pixelstruct](http://code.google.com/p/pixelstruct/) - A visualization tool for synths made with Bundler. Looks quite similar to what we need.
  * [OpenVis3D](http://code.google.com/p/openvis3d/)
  * [GARFEILD](http://cvlab.epfl.ch/software/bazar/html/group__garfeild.html) keypoint matching.
  * [Insight3D](http://labts.troja.mff.cuni.cz/~machl5bm/insight3d/) - Probably the most related to libmv, Insight3D is a modelling from wide-baseline photos package. GPLv2.
  * [EHCI](http://code.google.com/p/ehci/) - Realtime 3D head tracking.
  * [A series of blog posts about 3D reconstruction and the like](http://bardsley.org.uk/category/research/).
  * [Andrew Davison's SLAM](http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~ajd/software.html)
  * [Georg Klein's SLAM](http://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~gk/)
  * [fvision2008](http://code.google.com/p/fvision2008/) - Similar to libmv; uses OpenCV underneath. (Deprecated)
  * [fvision2010](http://code.google.com/p/fvision2010/) - Similar to libmv; uses OpenCV underneath.
  * [uniclop](http://code.google.com/p/uniclop/) - This project attempts to create an easy to use online self calibration software.
  * http://www.fit3d.info/ - FIT3D is a Matlab Toolbox that will allow to obtain a complete 3D model from a set of calibrated images.
